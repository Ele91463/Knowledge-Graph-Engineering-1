        <h1>Welcome to the Knowledge Graph Project</h1>
        <p>This is the project page where you can find information about the project on the Knowledge Graph.</p>

        <div class="section-header">
            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        </div>
        <p>The Knowledge Graph Project aims to model the relationships between various biological entities to better understand and predict patterns in human health, particularly with regard to cancer risk and microbiome analysis. The project uses data from various sources to construct a knowledge graph that integrates biological and medical data, enabling more effective analysis and discovery.</p>

        <div class="section-header">
            <h2>2. Information Gathering</h2>
        </div>
        <p>The project started by gathering extensive information about cancer risk, microbiomes, and human health. Key data sources included medical journals, online databases, and existing research on cancer biology. A comprehensive set of data was collected to build the knowledge graph, ensuring it could be used for further analysis and model building.</p>

        <div class="section-header">
            <h2>3. Language Definition</h2>
        </div>
        <p>The language used for the project is based on a semantic framework that allows us to represent complex relationships between biological entities and health metrics. This definition ensures consistency and accuracy in the way data is handled and queried in the knowledge graph.</p>

        <div class="section-header">
            <h2>4. Knowledge Definition</h2>
        </div>
        <p>The knowledge in the graph is structured into categories such as microbiome composition, cancer stages, and health profiles of individuals. These categories are linked to relevant concepts and entities, enabling easy retrieval of information relevant to specific health conditions.</p>

        <div class="section-header">
            <h2>5. Entity Definition</h2>
        </div>
        <p>Entities in the project represent biological entities such as microbes, cancer types, and health-related biomarkers. Each entity has attributes like age, gender, health status, and disease stage, which help in understanding their role in the broader context of cancer research.</p>

        <div class="section-header">
            <h2>6. Evaluation</h2>
        </div>
        <p>The knowledge graph was evaluated by comparing the results with known biological and health-related data. It was verified for accuracy and completeness, ensuring that the constructed model could provide meaningful insights for predicting cancer risk.</p>

        <div class="section-header">
            <h2>7. Metadata Definition</h2>
        </div>
        <p>Metadata is essential for sharing and distributing the resources generated by the project. The metadata includes information on the types of resources (data, language, and knowledge), their descriptions, and how they can be accessed or shared.</p>

        <div class="section-header">
            <h2>8. Open Issues</h2>
        </div>
        <p>This section addresses the remaining challenges that were not fully resolved during the project. Some issues include gaps in the data and difficulty in integrating certain datasets. Solutions were proposed but were not fully implemented due to time constraints.</p>

        <div class="section-header">
            <h2>Competency Questions (CQs)</h2>
        </div>
        <p>Competency Questions are used to validate the functionality of the knowledge graph. The questions below are based on hypothetical personas and situations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CQ-1 (P1-S1):</strong> Haruto is curious about how different microbes in his body interact and whether these interactions could impact his health, especially given his recent stage I cancer diagnosis and his long history of smoking.</li>
            <li><strong>CQ-2 (P2-S2):</strong> Yuki doesn’t understand why he is finally losing weight. Could he be facing an imbalance of the microbiome that impacted his weight?</li>
            <li><strong>CQ-3 (P3-S3):</strong> Given that Emiko is a healthy woman, what can be observed in the relative abundances of her microbiome?</li>
            <li><strong>CQ-4 (P4-S1):</strong> Given Riku’s stage IV cancer diagnosis, which microbial species are characteristic of advanced patients with cancer?</li>
            <li><strong>CQ-5 (P5-S3):</strong> After noticing blood in his stool, Kaito is anxious about his health. Can we infer if he has a high chance of developing gastrointestinal problems?</li>
            <li><strong>CQ-6 (P6-S2):</strong> How does Aiko’s alcohol consumption influence the composition and abundance of bacteria in her microbiome?</li>
            <li><strong>CQ-7 (P7-S1):</strong> Hana, in good health, wonders about positive co-occurrence relationships in her microbiome.</li>
            <li><strong>CQ-8 (P8-S2):</strong> Ren is curious about his high levels of Helicobacter pylori. How does its abundance correlate with other microbial species?</li>
        </ul>
